# Chaos Engineering Whitepaper v0.1

## What is Chaos Engineering

*Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.* - [Principles of Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/)

### Principles

The Principles of Chaos Engineering describe well the various characteristics of the discipline.

The definition covers most of the main important aspects of chaos engineering:

* it is a discipline rather than a process. In other words, it leans on the actors' capacity to stick to principles and make the right judgment call rather than following prescriptive rules about how they must conduct their effort. The discipline usually emerges from the actors, and their unique needs
* while this definition is specific about distributed systems, where chaos engineering provides great benefits, chaos engineering is concerned about any system with enough complexity. It gives the actors a way of navigating this complexity to learn, with improving production as the main target of the effort. While actors could, and likely should, carry chaos engineering effort into their non-production environment, it is best to perform it in production where it matters.

All of these facets are meant for actors to build confidence in their production system and feel they can become familiar with, and responsive to, its dynamic nature.

#### Terminology

Throughout this proposal, we will be using some terms that are fairly specific to the chaos engineering discipline:

* **hypothesis**: theory that an actor has about an aspect of their system's behavior after condition variations, described in terms of a result expressed as a quantity (ie. measurement)
* **experiment**: investigation of the hypothesis through variable measurement and observability of the system's state
* **instrumentation**: association between a particular result with an change in the system’s condition (the method of measurement)
* **calibration**: identification and refinement of the amount of uncertainty included in a result.
* **observability**: capability of a system to be considered from different angles while it is being used

## Why practice Chaos Engineering

### Harness and Improve System Reliability

Chaos Engineering as a practice lends itself to exploring facets of a system's
reliability such as its resilience, scalability, security, safety or
privacy.

All these dimensions of a system have a direct impact on end-users' perception. All systems experience unplanned events that cause degradation of performance. Experiencing degraded conditions may leave a lasting negative opinion of the
service a system renders. In the worst case scenario, poor conditions may lead to legal issues for the service provider.

In effect, Chaos Engineering is a unique practice to enable an organization
to harness and improve system reliability proactively and in a controlled manner, rather than respond to unplanned events under pressure.

### Benefits for Cloud Native Systems

Chaos Engineering lends itself well to Cloud Native Systems which, by
nature, provide the platform for strong system reliability.

Properties of Cloud Native Systems that benefit Chaos Engineering:

* **dynamic**: resources and services are designed to come and go, and cannot be trusted to remain for any specific amount of time
* **isolation of concerns**: outcomes of a well-focused chaos experiment should be easier to make sense of in a cloud environment
* **automation**: being API-driven makes them a great candidate for experimental automation needs
* **value observability**: cloud native systems expose mechanisms for an operator to observe the live system's behavior, which is an inherent expectation of a well-crafted chaos experiment

Through these properties, Chaos Engineering experiments can be
designed, implemented and automated to provide continuous auditing of the
impact of degraded conditions in the system. This feedback loop provides
great insights about platform and application behavior under stress,
allowing both to adapt and improve accordingly.

With that said, while Cloud Native Systems abstract large chunks of complexity
away from users, this complexity does not disappear altogether.
It is merely made simpler to deal with. Operators, and developers alike,
must understand the stack they rely on to offer relevant responses in face of adversarial conditions.

In a nutshell, Chaos Engineering reminds the actors that the underlying system,
for all its benefits, cannot be trusted nor become a black box.

Actors must remain active, and even proactive, in the lifecycle of their system.

### Software and Operational Practices In Production

Chaos Engineering is a new practice in the toolbox of product teams. While
most operational best practices focus upstream, Chaos Engineering looks downstream to production once the system is live.

Typically, testing happens either in development or a production-lookalike environment but it is seldom performed in production after  the system is in the hands of users. In other words, testing is most often performed in safe conditions whereas Chaos Engineering factors in a certain level of risk.

Chaos Engineering does not take results of an experiment in binary -
passed|not passed - fashion. Instead, results are meant to be analysed and
correlated with the system's state and events at the time the experiment
took place.

With that said, the practice of Chaos Engineering should benefit from
well-defined policies such as automation or reporting.

### Use Cases

So, what are the use cases for Chaos Engineering? As stated in the overview, there is no single golden rule that can be applied across the board.

However, here are a few areas where it makes sense to invest in Chaos Engineering:

* **Dependency on third-party providers that are ****out of actors'**** control**: what is the effect of using provider X, when that provider goes down?
* **Network dependent services:** Can we cope with a link failure when the network (internal or otherwise) cannot be trusted?
* **Service release impact may not be tested for peripheral aspects of the system:** How does a new poorly performing release of one of the internal services impact our system?
* **Testing the engagement process and ensuring employees understand how to respond to pages and where playbook resources are**: Do the actors know how to react in the case of failures, especially cascading failure modes?
* **Surfacing unknown/transitive dependencies within a system:** How well do the actors understand the dependencies within the system, especially as complexity increases?
* **Testing for service resilience** Are the services in the distributed system resilient and able to gracefully handle (and recover from) unexpected failures?
* **Service Inter-Dependency** How well does the system handle a degraded service that other services depend on?
* **Multi-cloud migration** Has the appropriate stress testing occurred on a distributed system that is moving to the cloud or spreading across many cloud?

## Practicing Chaos Engineering

### Getting Started With Chaos Engineering

#### Warning with the word Chaos

"Chaos" can be a scary word because of the ideas associated with it.
It is important to notice that the word _chaos_ is generic term for "complete disorder".
Chaos engineering is the discipline to run experiments to expose that chaos, to make it visible.
In our case, the chaos is in the system already.
By exposing the inherent chaos of a system, that system is better understood
and improvements can be made in order to make more it resilience.
In other words, to make the chaos less affecting the availability of the system.

If you see someone with a syringe and that person says to you: "I'm going to inject you with something it's going to be great".
Would you trust that person ? Probably not.
If you see a trained practitioner or a doctor with a syringe,
that syringe contains a vaccine and the doctor explains to you what is it going to do to your body with the potential benefits of it.
Would you trust that person ? Probably more than in the previous case.

So it is important to mention the benefits of chaos engineering when talking about it to someone is not familiar with it.
Talk about the results of the experiments as well as the experiments themselves.

#### System requirements to endure Chaos Engineering

Chaos Engineering is a fairly disruptive practice as it takes the position
that, by forcing the system away from its natural position, we can learn subtle
aspects of the system's behaviors that other testing practices wouldn't unearth.

To achieve useful learnings however, the system needs to be in a fairly reliable and predictable
state already. If the system is too fragile or its reactions to failures are completely unknown, either the learnings
would be trivial or would provide a high volume of false positives. The cost of running Chaos Engineering experiments under those conditions would be higher than traditional tests and would not provide more benefit than those tests. To maximize the Return On Investment for Chaos Engineering, it's important to begin with an understanding of your current steady state.

As we suggested, Chaos Engineering supports exploring the reliability of a
system. While being authoritative is a challenge this whitepaper will not take,
it is good to check the basics of your system:

* Security: Look at the [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page))
  project which provides good security approaches for various use cases.
* Logging: Your system needs to leave traces about what it is doing so you
  can investigate it. Central logging is often a requirement to make this
  process much smoother and faster.
* Monitoring: Your system constantly sends pulses about its current state. Those
  signals tell you something about how it fares when you capture the right
  metrics.
* Automation: Whenever you deal with enough complexity, automation can save your
  day. There are many levels of automation but Continuous Integration is a great starting point. Tackle this before moving on to
  Continuous Delivery, Deployment and perhaps even GitOps.
* Testing: You want to move fast but with a high degree of confidence. Testing
  is a must-do practice to achieve this confidence and develop meaning hypotheses.
* Alerting: The persons to be notified when a system behaves abnormally. An experiment can consist of testing those alerts are triggered.

Altogether, those have become common practices in building great software
infrastructure and applications. Chaos Engineering teams will thrive if
engineering have already figured out those for themselves. With that said, even
basic Chaos Engineering experiments can help you get useful information from your
system and how to improve it.

#### Chaos Engineering in production

In test environments, it is common to create conditions that best suit the testing scenarios you are running. Chaos Engineering experiments that are run in these environments may produce tailored outcomes rather than real-world reactions to the tests. Running Chaos Engineering experiments in production, therefore, is more useful because you will get a more realistic view into how your system will really react to failure.

While running in production may be the best approach, most organizations will want to start by running Chaos Engineering experiments in test environments until they are comfortable with the practice. This is completely acceptable but the real value of the experiments comes from running them in production so that should always be the end goal.

#### Communicate with the Organization

This is where we need to continue the discussion and figure out how far we want/can go with the patterns.

Should we talk game days for instance? Observability?
((comment from Lorinda - I think we should talk about game days, observability, logging/auditing and notifications. Those are all different examples of communication that happen at different stages. But in our experience, teams want the reassurance that communication will occur at key moments in the process and on a continuous basis))

The following phases may or may not be useful. I think it would be valuable if we could describe what it means to deal with chaos in those various cases, but is it the right place?

### Chaos Engineering Perturbations

#### Degrade Network Conditions

Network is one of the greatest complexity, as well as fragility, facet of any
systems. One often hears that network cannot be trusted.

It is therefore a place of choice for any Chaos Engineer to look for weaknesses.
The purpose is to gauge how one service copes with poor communication with
a service it depends on.

Common experiments can therefore:

* add latency to a network call (either on the receive, send or both)
* add jittering to create noise in the message
* lose any number of packets along the channel
* prevent name discovery
* randomly close connections
* inject random data into streams
* send all data to nowhere

Basically, any number of unhappy scenarios you can think of during a network
exchange is a candidate.

#### Vary Computing Resources

Resources allocated to a service should not be trusted to always be available.
Whether it's fighting for computing resources or attached devices going away,
it is critical that you harness the impact of any of those situations on your
system.

* Reduce the available amount of CPU or memory to a service
* Detach a device

#### Stress to the Limits

You may have designed your system to scale and handle a certain level of stress.
You may even have proven it in specific conditions through performance testing.
However, those types of testing don't usually take the chance of looking at the
system dealing with such stress while also enduring degraded conditions (such
as poor network or lost device) when often, failures pile up because of those
high loads in the first place.

#### Simulate Data Loss and its Recovery

Data loss is one of the most critical failure any service can face. Its response
often goes beyond engineering boundaries. Understanding the impacts of data loss
is therefore highly valuable to a Chaos Engineer.

Simulating data loss often depends on the model, architecture and storage of the
system so it experimenting for it will take different shapes.

* Remove storage
* Change permissions so a service cannot read or write
* Drop messages from a queue to prevent eventual consistency
* Duplicate messages and deal with integrity
* Perform a backup

#### Change ACLs Permissions

Never underestimate the impacts of an error in a configuration somewhere that
changes the ACL of a service towards another service.

#### Provoke a Security Breach

While security is its own topic, Chaos Engineers must not set aside but,
on the contrary, bring security experiments into the fore.

Things to look for:

* Simulate an expired certificate
* Broken authentication
* Various common injections (SQL...)
* Loading from unsafe sources of data

What a Chaos Engineer may be interested in looking for is how the system
copes with the dire situation, starting with whether the system detected the
attack in the first place.

#### Assume application fails to restart

How to handle an application which does not restart? If it's a new version, is
it incompatible with the rest of the system? Can you roll it back?

If it's an existing application, do you have a space issue on the disk? A change
of permissions on the filesystem?
